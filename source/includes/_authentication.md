# Authentication

## Basic

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

## Advanced

```ruby
require 'kittn'
do |config| while kittn=true
  api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('killthecat')
  ```
  
  Friend of mine from college. He also has a boat tho not called the Seaward. Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? I'll never forget your wedding. No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you. This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. And the soup of the day is bread.
